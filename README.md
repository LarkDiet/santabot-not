# santabot-not
A near-faithful recreation of the classic 2004 holiday chatbot.
Rescripted using rivescript-js.

## What?
SantaBot was a browser-based chatbot where the user could "chat" with Santa through an HTML form input.
Upon submission, the input would be sent to the server to be parsed by the bot logic, and the page would reload with the user's last input and Santa's reponse above the form field.
The website hosting the chatbot has since gone defunct, much to the dismay of children everywhere (and my friend Quint).
Snapshots of the front-facing portion of the site are available on the Wayback Machine, but they are non-functional without the underlying logic code.
